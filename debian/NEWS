org-mode (9.3+dfsg-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

    With the 9.3 release, upstream Org-mode renamed a number of libraries.
    The "org-" prefix for these files was changed to "ol-", and the
    provided feature names were also renamed.  Users of these packages
    should update their Emacs configuration to "(require 'ol-foo)"
    wherever "(require 'org-foo)" was previously used.  The renamed
    packages are: ol-bookmark.el, ol-elisp-symbol.el, ol-git-link.el,
    ol-man.el, ol-mew.el, ol-notmuch.el, ol-vm.el, ol-wl.el

org-mode (8.0.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

    To fix Debian bug #709494, and keep org-mode in the main section, the
    documentation has been removed from this package and moved to
    org-mode-doc, to be found soon in the non-free section.
